# PersonalMushaf

## Purpose
To streamline the process of memorizing the Qur'an by:
* providing tools that make memorizing more engaging and more sustainable to do consistently than current conventional methods
* making self-testing a viable option

### How will Personal Mushaf ___?

#### make memorizing more engaging

Most conventional methods currently require one to recite a short portion of a verse multiple times while looking, then to test the short term memory of that portion by reciting without looking. This process is rinsed and repeated for the whole amount that will be memorized. You guessed it, creating a method more engaging than that should be trivial. Literally any other way would be more engaging. The challenge lies in matching the effectiveness of this "brute-force" approach. 

To do that, this app will model the philosophy of the program Anki. Anki is widely-used today for it's approach of giving the user daily lessons optimized for long-term memory, based on self-feedback. The user can create a deck of flash-cards, then can have full confidence that they will know the cards inside-out in a couple weeks as long as they follow the daily lessons.
